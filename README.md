# caesars-cipher

Caesars cipher algorithm for freeCodeCamp.

The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher. This means the letters of a given string are shifted by a set amout.

Caesar cipher uses the ROT13 cipher. The values of the letters are shifted by 13 places e.g: `'A' <-> 'N'` and `'B' <-> 'O'`.

## Requirements

* Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
* All letters should be uppercase.
* Do not transform any non-alphabetic character.

## To try it

Just do `npm run convert "HELLO WORLD!"`.
